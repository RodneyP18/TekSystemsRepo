## Programs used to make the appliction:

* Node.js https://nodejs.org/en/
* Angular CLI by running this command "npm install -g @angular/cli" in your command line once Node.js is installed.
* MySQL Server and Workbench
* Spring Boot starter application. https://start.spring.io/
*   Dependencies: Lombok, Spring Boot DevTools, Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, MySQL Driver, Java-JWT with auth0

### Overview

* My focus for this project was to create a functioning WebService using JWT Authentication. 
* Currently on the frontend, the only functionality showcases the ability to Register and Login.
* In the backend though, there is customization pertaining to a custom Httpresponse class from which I have handled all my exceptions.


### Requirements met for the project

```
$ Built with a MVC framework.
$ Spring Security using JWT Authentication and auth0.
$ CSS located in frontend Angular application in the Home Component.
$ Core Java code and Models.
$ Use of MySQL Database and Hibernate.
$ Spring Framework with REST.
$ Use of Typescript in Angular to fulfill Javascript requirement.
$ All crud methods testable with Postman.
$ All Tests for the Servives and Repositories are found in the Test folder.
$ Slf4j logging to a file.
```

## Challenges

```
$ CORS Configuration was new to me and allowed me to understand further configuration a program would need.
$ Angular's typescript was familiar from learning Javascript, but brought challanges due to a new version release and deprecations.
$ JWT Token Authentication was new to me and require time to understand and implement the technology.
```
